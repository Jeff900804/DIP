# Term Project

According to the paper [K. -T. Shih and H. H. Chen, "Exploiting Perceptual Anchoring for Color Image Enhancement," in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 300-310, Feb. 2016, doi: 10.1109/TMM.2015.2503918.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7337421?casa_token=rIkrlg4_mfEAAAAA:jYkK8YLOXrEBQ2EEQJuxkuvqQcXZ-9btvzoeMybTLATr9BhbcFARtFYtWYaM0N44lzGvBO5ydwU) Replicate and simulate experimental results  

We referred to Professor Homer Chen's paper, which addresses the issue of 
reduced brightness and color accuracy under low backlight conditions. Inspired by 
the methods proposed in the paper, we aim to restore the overall brightness and 
color accuracy of images under low backlight conditions, making them 
comparable to the original images.  

This project is completed with Jerry, Chen is a postgradute student Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University.
