# HW5 has two problems  

### Problem 1  

Refer to the image and the disk structuring element shown in the lower right of the image. Sketch what the sets C, D, E, and F would look like for the following sequence of operations: C = A  B; D = C     B; E = D    B; and F = EB. Set A consists of all the foreground pixels (white), except the structuring element, B, which you may assume is just large enough to encompass any of the random elements in the image. Note that the sequence of operations above is simply the opening of A by B followed by a closing of the result by B.
