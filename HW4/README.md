# HW4 has two problems  

### Problem 1  
The purpose of this homework is to exercise how an image can be reconstructed using filtered backprojections and a ramp limited by a Hamming window as described in Example 5.17 of the textbook for an image of 600x600 pixels with black background and a central white square of 300x300 pixels. Generate your result using 0.5Â° increments of rotation and 849 projection rays as described in the textbook.  

### Problem 2  

JPEG uses the Huffman code defined in Table K.5 of the CCITT T.81 standard document to encode AC coefficients. A copy of the document is provided on NTU COOL for your information. Given the following quantized image block in the DCT domain:  

a) Determine the code stream for the AC coefficients of the image block.  

b) Suppose the DC component of the previous image block is -5. Determine the code stream for the DC coefficient of the image block.
