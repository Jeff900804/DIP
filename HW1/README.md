HW1 has three subroutines  

**Problem 1**  

a) The purpose of this homework is to implement a program for image resizing and rotation based on nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and bicubic interpolation. More precisely, you are asked to find the transformation that registers T.tif with T_transformed.tif. Your program will be tested and evaluated.  

b)Derive the impulse responses of the three interpolation schemes.  
**Problem 2**  

Write a program that takes the noisy image shown in Fig. 2.45(a) as input and generates a clean image as output. Your program will be tested and evaluated. Bonus points will be given if you go beyond the method described in the textbook and design your own.  
**Problem 3**  
Determine the intensity-level slicing function that would convert the following image to Fig. 3.12(c) and show the difference image between your resulting image and Fig. 3.12(c). Your program will be tested and evaluated. Your score will depend on the quality of your result.
