HW1 has three subroutines  

**Problem 1**
a) The purpose of this homework is to implement a program for image resizing and rotation based on nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and bicubic interpolation. More precisely, you are asked to find the transformation that registers T.tif with T_transformed.tif. Your program will be tested and evaluated.  

b)Derive the impulse responses of the three interpolation schemes.
